Contribution Line is a web application that helps individual professionals capture their real work contributions as they happen, so they can evidence their value during performance reviews, promotion discussions, and pay negotiations.

Over the course of a year, professionals contribute to multiple initiatives, unblock problems, take on responsibility outside their job description, and generate outcomes that are easily forgotten or undervalued when review time arrives. As a result, performance conversations are typically based on partial memory, recent activity, and generic role descriptions rather than concrete evidence.

Contribution Line addresses this by acting as a private system of record for professional contributions.

Users log meaningful contributions in short, structured entries at the time the work occurs. Each entry captures the context of the work (what was done and why), the nature of the contribution, and the outcome or impact, with optional supporting evidence such as links or documents. Entries accumulate chronologically in a private “master record” owned by the individual.

The core feature of the application is the ability to selectively assemble and present subsets of this record for specific purposes. Users can generate time-bounded, audience-appropriate views of their contributions (for example, “last 12 months”, “promotion case”, or “key initiatives”) without rewriting or duplicating content. This allows performance and pay conversations to be grounded in factual, well-organised evidence rather than ad-hoc reconstruction.

The application is individual-first. Records are private by default, portable, and persist independently of any employer or organisation. There are no social or public profile features in the initial scope. The focus is on consistent capture, low-friction recall, and clear presentation at the moment it matters.
